# Data analysis on life expectancy around the world

Hi! This is my first try on doing a data science project completely by myself.

All knowledge used for this project is from internet tutorials and guides :)

The intention for this is just to explore basic concepts of data analysis, graphs
and overall data manipulation.

## Installation

Install the required dependecies with:

```bash
  pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib

```
